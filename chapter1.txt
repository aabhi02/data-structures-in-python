This book covers a lot of ground quickly, without taking any shortcuts.
The concepts are motivated and start with simple examples.
Introducing the minimum necessary knowledge to make interesting programs and learn useful concepts is not taking shortcuts, itâ€™s just being directed.
The aim of this book is cover many of these topics as part of an integrated course.
The complex part is that many other concepts including problem solving strategies, more advanced Python, object-oriented design principles, and testing methodologies are introduced bit by bit throughout the text in a logical, incremental way.
