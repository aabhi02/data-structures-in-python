You should treat the test code as a user of the class and it should make no assumptions about private attributes. This way, if a private gets renamed or refactored, you don’t have to change the tests."

Often these expectations are expressed in if...then language, i.e., If I call this method with these parameters, then this will happen. A unit test will encode this expectation. It will check that the actual behavior of the code matches the expected behavior."
