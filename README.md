# data-structures-in-python

This repository is based on the book [A First Course On Data Structures in Python](https://donsheehy.github.io/datastructures/) by Donald R. Sheehy.<br>
The book has both theoretical and practical explanations.<br>
In this repository we can find the source code of all the chapters in the book.<br>
This repo will also help in quick glance of data-structures.<br>

Requirements:<br>
- Python 3.10.* (this codebase has been developed and tested for Python 3.10.*, although it should work from 3.9.\* without any issues.)
- Install ds2 use ```pip install ds2```

Here are some websites where you can visualize your written code:
- [PythonTutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) to visualize your own code.
- [Visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en) to visualize the algorithms.
- [Linked List Visualization](https://antoniosarosi.github.io/Linked-List-Visualization/) to visualize linked lists.
- [Hash Map/Hash Table Visualization](https://visualgo.net/en/hashtable) to visualize HashMaps.
